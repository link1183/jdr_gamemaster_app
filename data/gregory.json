Once on your turn, you can place a magical seal on a creature within 30 feet of you. You can either place this seal when you hit that target with a weapon attack (no action required), or you can use a bonus action to place this seal on a target you can see within range. This seal lasts for 1 minute or until burned (see &ldquo;Burning Seals&rdquo; below). A creature with one or more of your seals is referred to as an interdicted creature. Seals you place are invisible to other creatures, and when you can see an interdicted creature, the seals appear to you as glowing glyphs on the creatureâ€™s body.</p>\r\n<p>You can only place a limited number of seals before resting, and you regain all seals when you finish a short or long rest. The number of seals you can place increases as you gain illrigger levels, as indicated in the Seals column of the Illrigger table.</p>\r\n<p>If an interdicted creature dies, you can use a bonus action on your turn to move all seals placed on them to a new creature you can see within 30 feet of them. Each sealâ€™s duration continues to elapse when an interdicted creature dies and when that seal is moved to a new creature.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Burning Seals.</strong> When an interdicted creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage from any source other than a seal burned by an illrigger, you can burn any number of seals you placed on them to deal 1d6 fire or necrotic damage (your choice) to that creature per seal burned. You deal this damage immediately after the triggering damage. Burning a seal doesnâ€™t require an action from you, but you canâ€™t do so while incapacitated.</p>\r\n<p>Once a seal is burned, it immediately vanishes. Once you reach 5th level in this class, your connection to your archdevil strengthens. Each burned seal deals an extra 1d6 damage, for a total of 2d6. The damage of each seal increases again by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (for a total of 3d6) and 20th level (for a total of 4d6) in this class, as indicated in the Seal Damage column of the Illrigger table.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Interdict Save.</strong> Class features you gain later can add additional effects to your Baleful Interdict and require your target to make a saving throw to resist them. The saving throw DC for these effects uses your interdict save DC, which is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Interdict save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>",

The target must make a Wisdom saving throw; they can willingly fail this save. On a failed save, you are bound to the targetâ€™s awareness for a number of hours equal to the number of seals you expended, or until you use this boon on another creature. For the duration, while the target is within 300 feet of you, you can use an action to see and hear through their senses, gaining the benefit of any special senses the target possesses, and you continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses. While perceiving through the targetâ€™s senses, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, for the duration, you can place seals, burn them, and use interdict boons as if you were in the creatureâ€™s space, but doing so makes the creature aware of this bond.

If your attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to half your illrigger level (rounded down).</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"13thLevelInterdictBoons\">13th-Level Interdict Boons</h5>\r\n<p>When you reach 13th level, the following interdict boons are added to your list of Interdiction options.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Disâ€™s Onslaught (Passive).</strong> Each time you use a bonus action to place or move a seal, you can make one weapon attack as part of the same bonus action.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Flash of Brimstone.</strong> When you place or move a seal, you can activate this boon (no action required) to magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the target.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hellish Frenzy.</strong> When you start your turn within 30 feet of an interdicted creature, you can expend a seal to become frenzied by the power of Hell until the start of your next turn.

Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes a penalty to AC equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Iron Gaol.</strong> As an action, you can touch a creature and expend four seals to attempt to send that creature to Hell.

Otherwise, the target remains in the prison for 1 minute, after which they reappear in the space they left or in the nearest unoccupied space available; this target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect early on a success.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Last Word.</strong> When you are reduced to 0 hit points and have unplaced seals remaining, the hellfire in you refuses to die. You can expend up to 3 seals and release an explosion around you (no action required). Roll 3d6 per seal expended. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to the total you rolled. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. If this explosion damages at least one creature, you regain a number of hit points equal to the total you rolled.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Soulâ€™s Doom.</strong> When you use a bonus action to place or move a seal, you can scorch the seals into the targetâ€™s soul. For 1 minute, whenever that interdicted creature takes damage, they take extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>",

You can either place this seal when you hit that target with a weapon attack (no action required), or you can use a bonus action to place this seal on a target you can see within range. This seal lasts for 1 minute or until burned (see &ldquo;Burning Seals&rdquo; below). A creature with one or more of your seals is referred to as an interdicted creature. Seals you place are invisible to other creatures, and when you can see an interdicted creature, the seals appear to you as glowing glyphs on the creatureâ€™s body.</p>\r\n<p>You can only place a limited number of seals before resting, and you regain all seals when you finish a short or long rest. The number of seals you can place increases as you gain illrigger levels, as indicated in the Seals column of the Illrigger table.</p>\r\n<p>If an interdicted creature dies, you can use a bonus action on your turn to move all seals placed on them to a new creature you can see within 30 feet of them. Each sealâ€™s duration continues to elapse when an interdicted creature dies and when that seal is moved to a new creature.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Burning Seals.</strong> When an interdicted creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage from any source other than a seal burned by an illrigger, you can burn any number of seals you placed on them to deal 1d6 fire or necrotic damage (your choice) to that creature per seal burned. You deal this damage immediately after the triggering damage. Burning a seal doesnâ€™t require an action from you, but you canâ€™t do so while incapacitated.</p>\r\n<p>Once a seal is burned, it immediately vanishes. Once you reach 5th level in this class, your connection to your archdevil strengthens. Each burned seal deals an extra 1d6 damage, for a total of 2d6. The damage of each seal increases again by 1d6 when you reach 11th level (for a total of 3d6) and 20th level (for a total of 4d6) in this class, as indicated in the Seal Damage column of the Illrigger table.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Interdict Save.</strong> Class features you gain later can add additional effects to your Baleful Interdict and require your target to make a saving throw to resist them. The saving throw DC for these effects uses your interdict save DC, which is calculated as follows:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>Interdict save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>",

This seal lasts for 1 minute or until burned (see &ldquo;Burning Seals&rdquo; below). A creature with one or more of your seals is referred to as an interdicted creature. Seals you place are invisible to other creatures, and when you can see an interdicted creature, the seals appear to you as glowing glyphs on the creatureâ€™s body.</p>\r\n<p>You can only place a limited number of seals before resting, and you regain all seals when you finish a short or long rest. The number of seals you can place increases as you gain illrigger levels, as indicated in the Seals column of the Illrigger table.</p>\r\n<p>If an interdicted creature dies, you can use a bonus action on your turn to move all seals placed on them to a new creature you can see within 30 feet of them.

You deal this damage immediately after the triggering damage. Burning a seal doesnâ€™t require an action from you, but you canâ€™t do so while incapacitated.</p>\r\n<p>Once a seal is burned, it immediately vanishes. Once you reach 5th level in this class, your connection to your archdevil strengthens. Each burned seal deals an extra 1d6 damage, for a total of 2d6.

Some boons specify a minimum illrigger level; the boons in the &ldquo;7th-Level Interdict Boons&rdquo; section and the &ldquo;13th-Level Interdict Boons&rdquo; section canâ€™t be learned until you are at least that level.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"2ndLevelInterdictBoons\">2nd-Level Interdict Boons</h5>\r\n<p>You can choose from these boons when you gain the Interdiction feature at 2nd level, or whenever you gain a new boon.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abating Seal.</strong> When a creature you can see damages you or an ally within 30 feet of you, you can expend a seal as a reaction to reduce the damage taken by the target by an amount equal to 1d10 + half of your illrigger level (rounded down).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Bedevil.</strong> When you burn a seal on an interdicted creature, you can activate this boon (no action required). The target must subtract a number equal to your proficiency bonus from the result of the next saving throw they make before the end of their next turn.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Soul Eater.</strong> When you burn a seal on an interdicted creature, you can activate this boon (no action required) to gain temporary hit points equal to your illrigger level.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Styxâ€™s Apathy.</strong> When you burn a seal on an interdicted creature, you can use your reaction to flood the target with an otherworldly chill. Until the end of the targetâ€™s next turn, they canâ€™t take reactions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Swift Retribution (Passive).</strong> When an interdicted creature provokes an opportunity attack from you, you can make that attack without using your reaction, provided youâ€™re not incapacitated. Once you benefit from this boon, you canâ€™t do so again until the start of your next turn.</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"7thLevelInterdictBoons\">7th-Level Interdict Boons</h5>\r\n<p>When you reach 7th level, the following interdict boons are added to your list of Interdiction options.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Acheronâ€™s Chain.</strong> When you use a bonus action to place or move a seal on a Large or smaller creature, you can activate this boon (no action required). You conjure infernal chains to grasp the target, forcing them to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, you can either pull the creature 10 feet toward you or cause them to be grappled until the end of your next turn (escape DC equal to your interdict save DC).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conflagrant Channel.</strong> You can expend a seal as a bonus action to teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Eyes of the Gate.&nbsp;</strong>As an action, you can expend one or more seals to attempt to bind your awareness to a creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw; they can willingly fail this save. On a failed save, you are bound to the targetâ€™s awareness for a number of hours equal to the number of seals you expended, or until you use this boon on another creature. For the duration, while the target is within 300 feet of you, you can use an action to see and hear through their senses, gaining the benefit of any special senses the target possesses, and you continue to do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses. While perceiving through the targetâ€™s senses, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally, for the duration, you can place seals, burn them, and use interdict boons as if you were in the creatureâ€™s space, but doing so makes the creature aware of this bond. An aware creature can use their action to repeat the saving throw, ending the effects of this boon on a success.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Shadow Shroud.</strong> You can expend a seal as a bonus action to weave a mantle of semisolid shadows around yourself or a creature you touch. The target gains a +2 bonus to AC for 1 minute.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Unleash Hell.</strong> When you burn one or more seals on an interdicted creature, you can use your reaction to unleash an explosion of hellish energy around them. Each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes the same amount and type of damage as the seals dealt to the interdicted creature. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Vengeful Shot.</strong> When a creature makes a ranged attack against you or an ally you can see within 30 feet of you, you can expend a seal as a reaction to make a ranged weapon attack against the attacker. If your attack hits, it deals extra damage equal to half your illrigger level (rounded down).</p>\r\n<h5 id=\"13thLevelInterdictBoons\">13th-Level Interdict Boons</h5>\r\n<p>When you reach 13th level, the following interdict boons are added to your list of Interdiction options.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Disâ€™s Onslaught (Passive).</strong> Each time you use a bonus action to place or move a seal, you can make one weapon attack as part of the same bonus action.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Flash of Brimstone.</strong> When you place or move a seal, you can activate this boon (no action required) to magically teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of the target.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hellish Frenzy.</strong> When you start your turn within 30 feet of an interdicted creature, you can expend a seal to become frenzied by the power of Hell until the start of your next turn. While frenzied, your movement speed is doubled, you have a +2 bonus to your AC, and you can make an extra weapon attack when you take the Attack action.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Hellsight.</strong> You can expend a seal as an action to gain truesight out to 60 feet for 1 hour.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Impaling Shot.</strong> When you hit an interdicted creature with a ranged weapon attack, you can expend a seal as a bonus action to create a weak point in their defenses. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes a penalty to AC equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Iron Gaol.</strong> As an action, you can touch a creature and expend four seals to attempt to send that creature to Hell. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be pulled through a rift into the prisons of your archfiendâ€™s infernal city.</p>\r\n<p>If the target is native to Hell, or if their level or challenge rating is 4 or lower, they remain there and must find their own way out. Otherwise, the target remains in the prison for 1 minute, after which they reappear in the space they left or in the nearest unoccupied space available; this target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect early on a success.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Last Word.</strong> When you are reduced to 0 hit points and have unplaced seals remaining, the hellfire in you refuses to die. You can expend up to 3 seals and release an explosion around you (no action required). Roll 3d6 per seal expended. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to the total you rolled. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. If this explosion damages at least one creature, you regain a number of hit points equal to the total you rolled.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Soulâ€™s Doom.</strong> When you use a bonus action to place or move a seal, you can scorch the seals into the targetâ€™s soul. For 1 minute, whenever that interdicted creature takes damage, they take extra damage equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>",
